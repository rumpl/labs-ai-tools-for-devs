# Circleci MCP Server

A specialized server implementation for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) designed to integrate with CircleCI's development workflow. This project serves as a bridge between CircleCI's infrastructure and the Model Context Protocol, enabling enhanced AI-powered development experiences.

## Tools Details

#### Tool: **`config_helper`**
This tool helps analyze and validate and fix CircleCI configuration files.

  Parameters:
  - params: An object containing:
    - configFile: string - The full contents of the CircleCI config file as a string. This should be the raw YAML content, not a file path.

  Example usage:
  {
    "params": {
      "configFile": "version: 2.1
orbs:
  node: circleci/node@7
..."
    }
  }

  Note: The configFile content should be provided as a properly escaped string with newlines represented as 
.

  Tool output instructions:
    - If the config is invalid, the tool will return the errors and the original config. Use the errors to fix the config.
    - If the config is valid, do nothing.
Parameters|Type|Description
-|-|-
`params`|`object`|

---
#### Tool: **`find_flaky_tests`**
This tool retrieves information about flaky tests in a CircleCI project. 

    The agent receiving this output MUST analyze the flaky test data and implement appropriate fixes based on the specific issues identified.

    CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
    1. Truncation Handling (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
       - ALWAYS check for <MCPTruncationWarning> in the output
       - When present, you MUST start your response with:
         "WARNING: The logs have been truncated. Only showing the most recent entries. Earlier build failures may not be visible."
       - Only proceed with log analysis after acknowledging the truncation

    Input options (EXACTLY ONE of these two options must be used):

    Option 1 - Direct URL (provide ONE of these):
    - projectURL: The URL of the CircleCI project in any of these formats:
      * Project URL: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/gh/organization/project
      * Pipeline URL: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/gh/organization/project/123
      * Workflow URL: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/gh/organization/project/123/workflows/abc-def
      * Job URL: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/gh/organization/project/123/workflows/abc-def/jobs/xyz

    Option 2 - Project Detection (ALL of these must be provided together):
    - workspaceRoot: The absolute path to the workspace root
    - gitRemoteURL: The URL of the git remote repository

    Additional Requirements:
    - Never call this tool with incomplete parameters
    - If using Option 1, the URLs MUST be provided by the user - do not attempt to construct or guess URLs
    - If using Option 2, BOTH parameters (workspaceRoot, gitRemoteURL) must be provided
    - If neither option can be fully satisfied, ask the user for the missing information before making the tool call
Parameters|Type|Description
-|-|-
`params`|`object`|

---
#### Tool: **`get_build_failure_logs`**
This tool helps debug CircleCI build failures by retrieving failure logs.

    CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
    1. Truncation Handling (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
       - ALWAYS check for <MCPTruncationWarning> in the output
       - When present, you MUST start your response with:
         "WARNING: The logs have been truncated. Only showing the most recent entries. Earlier build failures may not be visible."
       - Only proceed with log analysis after acknowledging the truncation

    Input options (EXACTLY ONE of these two options must be used):

    Option 1 - Direct URL (provide ONE of these):
    - projectURL: The URL of the CircleCI project in any of these formats:
      * Project URL: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/gh/organization/project
      * Pipeline URL: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/gh/organization/project/123
      * Workflow URL: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/gh/organization/project/123/workflows/abc-def
      * Job URL: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/gh/organization/project/123/workflows/abc-def/jobs/xyz

    Option 2 - Project Detection (ALL of these must be provided together):
    - workspaceRoot: The absolute path to the workspace root
    - gitRemoteURL: The URL of the git remote repository
    - branch: The name of the current branch

    Additional Requirements:
    - Never call this tool with incomplete parameters
    - If using Option 1, the URLs MUST be provided by the user - do not attempt to construct or guess URLs
    - If using Option 2, ALL THREE parameters (workspaceRoot, gitRemoteURL, branch) must be provided
    - If neither option can be fully satisfied, ask the user for the missing information before making the tool call
Parameters|Type|Description
-|-|-
`params`|`object`|
